         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Proteſtant Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FOR ſuch I ſuppoſe thee to be, who will take the pains to read over theſe Collections, or take a view of this little Tract, called <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Remembrancer,</hi> wherein we have ſet forth, without any partiality, the bloody Perſecutions of that <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo we may well call her, ſince Perſecution is a certain Mark of the Beaſt; and whatever particular Church takes up that Weapon, ſo far deviates from the true Catholick Church of Chriſt, as it makes uſe of it being abſolutely contradictory to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> laid the Foundation of their Reformation with the blood of many Martyrs, ſuffering Death and torments for their Opinions. They were all Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently blamed, as they juſtly ought, their horrid Perſecution for Conſcience ſake, ſeeking by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
<pb facs="tcp:62591:3"/>to put their heavy yoaks on the necks of others, and yet they had Law on their ſide, and their Religion was then eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Land; however, I think there is no Proteſtant, but doth juſtly call the putting to death, tormenting, impriſoning, and ruining ſo many Men and Women for their Opinions, Perſecution; and tho the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath not law to put any to Death, yet no queſtion there may be many, ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zealous, as would do as much as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have done before them, and therefore let them not be angry, if that Spirit which ſome have of late ſhewed againſt Diſſenters, be called Perſecution, tho they have Laws of their ſide. But this is nothing; our dread and fear proceed from a farther proſpect of the great hopes the Papiſts have, of once more Eſtabliſhing their Idolatrous Religion; and truly, though we believe that God in his mercy may deliver this poor Nation from ſo great a Scourge, yet we cannot ſay, that the Hopes of the Papiſts are in vain, ſince we our ſelves do not ſlackly endeavour, to bring ruine on our ſelves, and to be helpful in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting their deſigns, being ready to ſet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants together by the Ears, reviling, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, and troubling one another, inſomuch that many have ſhewn, that they had rather join with the Papiſts, than admit of any other Proteſtant Diſſenter, to live unmoleſted, and to enjoy their peace, opinions, and Conſcience. This Spirit of late blown up by ſecret bout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
<pb facs="tcp:62591:3"/>raging as it does, makes the ſubtle Popiſh Clergy laugh in their Sleeves, and begin to believe they need not the help of any damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and murthering Plot, ſince they perceive we are framing Plots and Deſigns againſt our ſelves, and if they let us alone, ſhall readily, by our animoſities, make way for the ſetting up their Church in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they with all their helliſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices could never do. <hi>Divide &amp; impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, divide &amp; reign,</hi> is a known Maxim, and we are doing that our ſelves as faſt as we can for them. At this time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thought there could be nothing more neceſſary to all ſorts of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> of what denomination ſoever, than the beholding, as in a little mirror, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and bloody Perſecutions of thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church in <hi>England,</hi> when they had power in this Nation, and by this Pocket Remembrancer, you may be able to perceive to what horrid Tyranny all Profeſſors of the true Goſpel of Chriſt muſt ſubmit themſelves, giving their Bodies to be burnt, impriſoned, tormented, and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or elſe againſt their Conſciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Idolaters, and damn their Souls. Alas! there are no Arguments to be uſed againſt theſe men, when armed with the Sword of Power: what they have done they ſtill do, where they reign, and will moſt certainly do the ſame again, if not in a greater and more bloody manner,
<pb facs="tcp:62591:4"/>as ſoon as they ſhould have eſtabliſhed their Dominion, by the help of a Popiſh King. You therefore who are negligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and act as if you were aſleep, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, what Religion is uppermoſt, and you alſo who are ſo hot and zealous, for perſecuting all thoſe who diſſent from you, and you likewiſe (for ſuch there be) who are ready to ſhake hands with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, pleading for them, and account them harmleſs and loyal, or at leaſt better than Proteſtant Diſſenters; all of you I ſay, read this little Book of their Tyrannies, and as ſure as Truth, you ſhall feel the Scourge and Scorpionian ſting of theſe men, and muſt draw in their iron Yoak, unleſs you will act againſt your Conſciences; the very ſame Tragedies that were acted before, under Popiſh and bigotted Kings, upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhall be then acted over again upon you, your Wives, and Children, upon your Goods, Lives, Friends, Kindred, and Eſtates. Fires will again be inkindled in all quarters of this Land, the Tyranny and Cruelty of the Inquiſition ſhall ſit upon you, the Prieſt ſhall Lord it over you, and of Freemen, you ſhall become ſlaves; ignorance and ſuperſtition ſhall put down knowledge and Religion by Authority. On the other ſide, you who are true profeſſors of the Goſpel of Chriſt, may make uſe of this <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> in which you will behold the great patience &amp; meekneſs of ſuch, whom God honoured with Martyrdom,
<pb facs="tcp:62591:4"/>and ſuffering in his Cauſe, that if ever the like perſecution be permitted by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, in this Nation, for our manifold ſins and debaucheries, which flow thorow the Land, and for the Spirit of Rage and Perſecution of one another, that hath lately gone forth in ſome meaſure; I ſay, you may be prepared by theſe examples of holy dying men, how to behave your ſelves, and to believe, that God will give to ſuch as rely upon him, extraordinary Comforts and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in their Afflictions. It may alſo ſerve to ſtir up thoſe lukewarm Proteſtants, who run with the ſtream, or have not heard of, or elſe ſoon forget the Perſecutions and Tyrannies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, to have an averſion and horrour to ſuch men, and ſuch a Religion, as will cut their throats if ever eſtabliſhed by Law among us. You have here an Epitomy of all Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s 3 great Volumes, which few can purchaſe, and fewer have time to read; therefore I have collected for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Reader,</hi> briefly the moſt material ſtories of the whole, which are faithfully and truly ſet down, and I hope God will give a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to theſe my true endeavours, and this very uſeful Book at this time; that all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of whatſoever denomination, may joyn together in the bond of unity, to oppoſe this Bloody, Cruel, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, of all that profeſs the Truth of the Goſpel, and to endeavour, that the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> may never get
<pb facs="tcp:62591:5"/>Power, and Dominion in this Land: Which I pray God avert, and protect us from. And to which Prayer, let all good People ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THe Corruptions and great abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with the Heretical, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous, Impious, and Blaſphemous Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines and practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo its bloody Perſecutions abroad, have been ſhewn in ſeveral volumes, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authors: but ſince, what hath been tranſacted by that Church in our own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, more nearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerns us; I have here given you a true view of the Perſecutions of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> from the beginning, againſt all ſuch as diſſented from them, and would not bow down to their Images, or Worſhip God after their way; by which you may ſee, what Spirit they are of, quite contrary to that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and to what ſlavery we ſhould be brought, if God ſhould permit once more the <hi>Papal</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to get footing in theſe reformed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; which for ſo many years, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of blood, and the lives of many holy Men and Martyrs, have ſhaken off that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Yoak of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is my deſign, not to tranſcur the Bounds
<pb facs="tcp:62591:6"/>of our own Country, for where ever the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have ſet up themſelves, they have continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After that Errors were crept into the Church, and that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church had ſought and obtained by many impious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, the ſupremacy over other Churches, ſhe endeavoured to maintain this her uſurpt Authority, by Tyranny and bloody Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſhe doth to this Day, where ever her rule is permitted. That is a moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Queſtion of ſome of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorant <hi>Proteſtants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where was your Religion before Luther?</hi> All your Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers in <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Papiſts;</hi> why ſhould you then change your old Religion, for many hundred years eſtabliſh'd in <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62591:6"/>for one of a new date, and but of the other days ſtanding? This has taken with ſome, but they are ſuch as are very ignorant, or elſe they may reply to ſuch Querors, that though the Name of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> be new, and came from <hi>Germany</hi> in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, from proteſting againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> decrees, that were to have been impoſed upon them, yet the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches, are as ancient as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> itſelf, and neareſt to that of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his holy Apoſtles and Succeſſors in the primitive times, before <hi>Rome</hi> came to challenge a ſupremacy over other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or to pretend to be the Spiritual Head of the World.</p>
            <p>In all Ages, and thorow the moſt Corrupt of times, the purity of the Goſpel has been preſerved, &amp; like a ſhining light, has mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted itſelf, in its diſſent, from the evil &amp; ſinful practiſes, &amp; from the falſe and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and has been ſtill perſecuted by it, long before the times of <hi>Luther,</hi> as is manifeſted by the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> and the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> itſelf, where many profeſſing the purity of the Goſpel, and teſtifying againſt the errors and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, fell under the

            <p>But deſigning (as I have ſaid) to ſpeak only of our own Country, we ſhall begin with the earlieſt Perſecutions of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in this Land, who always hated Diſſenters from them, or ſuch as would not own their unjuſt Supremacy over their Brethren. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> began very early in <hi>England,</hi> and a Chriſtian Church was planted here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as at <hi>Rome,</hi> and continued without any acknowledgment of her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority all the time of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Reign; for the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Churches never owned any forreign Church ſupream, or above them, or ſuffered any to exerciſe Dominion or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, but ſubmitted themſelves to their Kings, and their <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> as their head. <hi>Auſtine</hi> the Monk was the firſt who endeavoured to bring into this Land the Authority of <hi>Rome;</hi> and becauſe the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops would not own it, he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the Heathen <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of this Land, to perſecute them, and others Converted to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and of the <hi>Papiſtical</hi> Principles, of ſetting up the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> above others to kill and deſtroy the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Chriſtians, as diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from them. But yet, till about the year <hi>980,</hi> the purity of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:62591:7"/>preſerved itſelf againſt <hi>Popiſh</hi> errors; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which time, <hi>Popery,</hi> that is, the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> of that Church, or the owning it to the head over others, getting ground in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in other places, and with it, all the filthineſſes and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which diſſenting <hi>Proteſtants</hi> diſown, and ſpeak againſt; all that any ways oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this ſupremacy, and erroneous Doctrines, were perſecuted, and troubled by them, tho they were not as yet come to fire and faggot, wanting not will but power to do it. I ſhall but mention only that good Biſhop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln, Robert Groſthead,</hi> who wrote againſt the wickedneſs of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy, in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. which vext them ſo much, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> would have had the Biſhops bones, after his death, to have been dug up, and flung out of the Church, where he was buried, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have wrote to the King of <hi>England</hi> for that purpoſe, he was ſtrucken by the ſaid Biſhop (appearing to him in his ſleep) with his Croſiers ſtaff, reproving him of his wicked intention, which prohibited him from proceeding therein. After which time, the <hi>Papal</hi> wickedneſſes increaſing in this Nation, <hi>Sathan</hi> was let looſe, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perſecutions began to ariſe, againſt
<pb facs="tcp:62591:8"/>thoſe who made a profeſſion of the Goſpel, and oppoſed the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition, or diſſented from it. I ſhall therefore here end this introduction, and begin the Hiſtory of Popiſh perſecutions here in <hi>England,</hi> about the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, about which time they began more eminently to appear, and ſo God willing, I ſhall briefly proſecute them to our own times, thorow that flood of Martyrs blood ſhed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days.</p>

He had for his ſpecial maintainors the great <hi>John of Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the Kings Son; and the noble Lord <hi>Henry Peircy,</hi> both which were his great Friends, embracing the Truth of His Doctrine, and perceiving the impurity of that profeſſed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, together with their moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and vicious Life. But for the appearing of this noble Duke, for the Truth and ſiding with <hi>Wickliff,</hi> the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy perfectly hated him, and the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> moſt horridly aſperſes him of Baſtardy, making the Queen upon her Death bed to Confeſs it to him, that he was not the Kings Son, nor hers, for lying in at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the child ſhe had was Smother'd, and fearing the Kings diſpleaſure, ſhe cauſed this <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> being a poor womans Son then newly brought to bed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititiouſly to be brought up inſtead of the dead Prince. Thus, for his owning <hi>Wickliff,</hi> he had this wicked abuſe put upon him, by that proud Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. But the Duke, not induring the affront, cauſed him to be condemned by Parliament, and his temporalities confiſcated, and the ſaid Biſhop was prohibited to come within 20 miles of the Court, But not long after by the means of <hi>Alice Pierce</hi> the Kings Minion, being well brib'd, and by the interceſſion of the whole Company of the Biſhops, he was again reſtored. But now <hi>Wickliff</hi> as I ſaid, about the year 1377. was forbid to preach any more, and cited to appear before the Biſhops, which was on the 19th of <hi>February:</hi> The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62591:11"/>Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and the Lord <hi>Henry Peircy,</hi> both accompanied him, and cauſed out of every order of the Fryers, a Batchelour of Divinity to be choſen, which were 4 to joyn with <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and to Aſſiſt him.</p>
                  <p>But ſo great was the diſorder and variance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Biſhop of <hi>London, Courtney,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Henry Peircy,</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> that nothing was done, and the Aſſembly was broke up, being held in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, the Duke and the Biſhop threatning one another. Thus he eſcaped at this time, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unmoleſted all the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, but afterwards in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, though he was a favourer of <hi>Wickliffs</hi> Doctrines, yet the Duke and Lord <hi>Peircy</hi> not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling in the Affairs of ſtate as before, but living privatly, the Biſhops took their time to trouble him, again, and exhibited ſeveral Articles againſt him, to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 11th, who preſently ſends his bull to <hi>Oxford</hi> for the Apprehending of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and for the ſilencing him, and rooting out his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and writes alſo to the King againſt him. The Biſhops now hoping to ruine this holy man, cite him a Second time, who appeared, but there came a Command to them from the King not to give any definitive ſentence againſt him, ſo that he by that means eſcaped them a 2d time.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the Rebellion of <hi>Jack-ſtraw</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, and the Kingdom in a Combuſtion, the Biſhops perceiving the Doctrine of <hi>Wickliff</hi> dayly to increaſe, and that he had many followers, they procured the Vicechancellour of <hi>Oxford, William Barton,,</hi> in the year 1380 to put forth an Edict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Wickliff</hi> and his followers, which again brought him into trouble, not having his former ſupports to help him, and his Articles which he had maintained, ſo ſtoutly againſt the force of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, were condemned as Heretical in 1382. About the ſame time one <hi>Hereford</hi> with <hi>Rippington</hi> and <hi>Aſhton</hi> all Batchelours of Divinity were cited
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62591:12"/>before the Biſhops, &amp; perſecuted for holding the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Rippington</hi> were excommunicated. Alſo one <hi>Thomas Hillman</hi> a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellor of Divinity, was at the ſame time trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by them for the ſame cauſe. Hitherto there was no Law to burn any man for Religion, and had they been contented with the power of excommunication, it had been well, and had not ſtirred up the Civil Magiſtrate to be their bloody and Cruel executioners, ſo that we may account theſe firſt Perſecutions but light. But now their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice &amp; rage being increaſed, the K. being but young, and overawed by the Pope and the proud and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious clergy of the Land, who bore great ſway, they circumvented the King, &amp; got ſurreptitiouſly a ſtatute made without notice of the Commons, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Act of the Parliament holden at <hi>Weſtminſter An.</hi> 5. <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> in which power was given to Sheriffs, and other Civil Magiſtrates, to impriſon any for Religion, upon the Certificates of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: which cauſed great Perſecutions but this Act was ſhortly after repealed at the intreaty of the Commons: However, the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whoſe Doctrines alſo were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly defended by <hi>John Hus</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who was martyred for the ſame. But for all this the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergies inveterate malice againſt <hi>Wickliff,</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 41 years after he was buried; for, by a Decree of the Synod of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> they cauſed this holy mans Bones to be dug out of his Grave, and burnt, and the Aſhes to be flung into the River.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Wickliff</hi> notwithſtanding daily increaſed, to the no ſmall grief of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy; and his Followers, or thoſe profeſſing his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines (which were contrary to thoſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and many of them, or moſt of them, ſuch as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> now hold) began then to be called <hi>Lollards,</hi> for they had then Nick-names, as well as now, for ſuch as profeſt the purer Light of the Goſpel. After <hi>Wickliff</hi> was gone, they ſet themſelves to ſuppreſs theſe <hi>Lollards,</hi> as they called them, the Pope interpreting the Word from <hi>Loll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> Cocle or Darnel, and one <hi>William Swinderly,</hi> a Prieſt, in 1389. was brought into great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by theſe men, for holding and preaching ſome of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Doctrines; and was condemned by the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> for an Heretick; but <hi>Swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi> appealed to the King, and to the Parliament, and during King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Reign he was protected from their Violence; but it is thought he ſuffered Martyrdom afterwards in the days of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. when the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy had got more power. About the ſame time alſo they perſecuted <hi>Walter Brute</hi> a Lay-Man, but bred up in the <hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62591:13"/>of him, and that he had avouched the Pope to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and that the Sentence given againſt <hi>Swinderly</hi> was unjuſt. For theſe things he is brought before the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> where he learnedly maintained his Aſſertions againſt them; but being put to horrible Trouble and Vexation, was forced at laſt to make a Submiſſion, which was, that he ſubmitted to the Cenſure of the Goſpel, the Church, and General Councils, and to St. <hi>Auguſtine, Jerom, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> and to his Biſhop as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And ſo he eſcaped at that time, but whether he ſuffered afterwards is uncertain. About this time Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9th made a Bull againſt the <hi>Lollards,</hi> and ſent it to King <hi>Richard</hi> 2d. who, by the Inſtigation of <hi>Courtney,</hi> then Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, iſſued out his Letters againſt the <hi>Lollards,</hi> as Hereticks, ſo that by this means many were forced to do Pennance, and to abjure, many were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned and evilly intreated; but during his Reign none were burnt.</p>

                  <p>The next noted man who was perſecuted by theſe Tyrannical bloodſuckers, was Sr. <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> Ld. <hi>Cobham,</hi> who was a favourer &amp; Principal maintainer of good men, called by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts <hi>Lollards,</hi> who could not bring their conſciences to ſubmit to their wicked impieties, and groſs Idolatries. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel</hi> had cauſed certain Inquiſitors, who brought in Articles againſt the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> for being a mighty maintainer of ſuſpected preachers in the Dioceſs of <hi>London, Rocheſter,</hi> and other places, and that he aſſiſted &amp; relieved them, and that he himſelf had not a true belief of the Sacrament, penance, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, worſhiping of Images, and of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical power and Juriſdiction: Which proceſs was awarded againſt him as a moſt pernicious here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> being a great man, and in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alſo with the King, theſe blood thirſty Prelats firſt make their complaints againſt him to the King, who having heard them, ſpake himſelf in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> deſiring them to deal gently with him, and to ſeek to reduce him to the Unity of the Church by fair means, promiſing them his aſſiſtance therein. And accordingly he ſent for that worthy Lord, and privately admoniſhed him to ſubmit himſelf to the Church. To whom the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> anſwered, that next to God he owed his Obedience to the King, as his ſoveraign, and that he ſhould ever obey him as his faithful leige man, and all his Laws, and ready to fulfil his will in all things, but as to this touching the Pope, and his Spirituality, he did not owe any ſuit or ſervice, for that the Scriptures had taught him that he was the great Antichriſt, the ſon of Perdition, and open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of God. which the King hearing, and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill from him, forſook him, and left him a prey to his bloody Adverſaries, who much deſired his Death. He was thereupon cited before the Arch-Biſhops,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62591:16"/>and not appearing was Excommunicated, and then cited again. This good Lord finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf involved in troubles, wrote a rehearſal of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and ſent it to the King, But the King would not receive it, but ordered him to be taken into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, and delivered to his Adverſaries his Judges. The good Lord beholding himſelf forſaken, offered to bring 100 Knights and Eſquires, to come in for his purgation, to clear him of Hereſie, and alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf, to fight for his Life, according to the Law of Arms, with any man living, in the quarrel of his Faith, the King and the Lords of his Council only excepted. Notwithſtanding all this, the King ſuffered him to be ſummoned in his own privy Chamber, upon which he appealed from the Arch-Biſhop to the Pope, wherewith the King was more highly diſpleaſed than before, and he was thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on arreſted and carried to the Tower. After that he was brought before the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> The Biſhops of <hi>London, Wincheſter,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where he ſtrenuouſly and with great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment argued his caſe, but at laſt they pronounced a definitive ſentence againſt him for an Heretick.

                  <p>In the reigns of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 5th and his Bloody Uncle and Uſurper King <hi>Rich.</hi> 3d we do not find any Martyr'd, their Reigns being but ſhort, and full of Trouble, but in the Reign of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 7th about the year 1494, there was a very ancient Lady about 80 years of Age, named <hi>Joan Boughten,</hi> burnt in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for holding the opinions of <hi>Wickliff.</hi> She dyed on the 28 of <hi>April,</hi> being very conſtant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the menaces of Biſhops, that ſhe knew her ſelf beloved of God, and his holy Angels, and that ſhe feared not the Fire, and in the midſt thereof ſhe cryed to God to receive her Soul. She was much beloved, and her Aſhes were carried away by ſuch as ſecretly profeſſed the Goſpel, and kept as a Relick.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1497 ſeveral were forced to do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance bare footed and bare headed, with faggots on their ſhoulders before St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Croſs, during the

He was about 60 years of Age, who being bound to the Stake, and the Faggots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, ready to ſuffer, the barbarous Papiſts cauſed his only daughter, being a Marryed woman, to ſet fire to her own Father, her Husband <hi>John Clark</hi> doing pennance at the ſame time, with a Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got before the fire, with many others. And the next day after one Father <hi>Roberts</hi> was Martyr'd at <hi>Buckingham:</hi> At whoſe burning there were 9 Perſons forced to bear Faggots for pennance.

And at the ſame time there were thirty more, who bare Faggots and were burned in the right cheek: The manner thus: Their necks were tyed faſt with Towels to a Poſt, and their hands bound, that they could not ſtir, and ſo the Iron being hot, was clapt to their cheeks being ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized for the Goſpels ſake. And this we muſt look for again, whenever Popery comes to have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this Kingdom. At the ſame time one Father <hi>Rogers</hi> was kept in the Biſhops Priſon, for 14 weeks, night and day, and ſo cruelly handled with cold, hunger, and Irons, that when he was let forth of priſon he could never go upright as long as he liv'd.</p>

Therefore to put a ſtop to this, and to be revenged on him, they

So that none of his Friends were ſuffer'd to come at him. And from thence, by the inſtigation of Dr. <hi>Horſey</hi> a cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter, and the Biſhops Chancellour, he was had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop at his manour Houſe at <hi>Fulham,</hi> where he was examined, and certain Articles laid to his charge. That he had taught and publiſhed, that Tythes were not ordained as due by God, but by the Covetouſneſs of Prieſts: That the Biſhops and Prieſts were the Scribes and Phariſes that crucified Chriſt: That they were only preachers and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but no doers of Gods word: That he ſhould ſay, he would defend the opinions of <hi>Joan Barker,</hi> that was forced to abjure: That he ſhould ſay, the Biſhop and his Officers deſerved puniſhment, rather than the aforeſaid <hi>Joan Barker.</hi> Laſtly that he kept Heretical Books, damned by the Law, ſuch as the <hi>Apccalips</hi> in <hi>Engliſh:</hi> The Epiſtles and Goſpels in <hi>Engliſh, Wickliffs</hi> damnable works, and the like.

Several Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were put in againſt him, and among the reſt this, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould ſay all laud &amp; praiſe ſhould be given to God alone, and not to Saints or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He very learnedly anſwered all the Articles put in againſt him, and offered to diſpute with the moſt learned of them, the points which he aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but they had other more powerfull Weapons to fight with than words, the Papal Juriſdiction by which they condemned him, firſt for a relapſed Heretick, and then ſentenced him to be degraded, upon which Mr. <hi>Bayfeild</hi> being moved more than Ordinary, ſaid to the Biſhop who had pronounced the ſentence againſt him. The Life of you of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality is ſo evil, that ye be hereticks, for ye do not only live evilly, but ye maintain evil living con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the true belief of Chriſts Church. Upon which they proceeded act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually to degrade him; which done they delivered him over to the Secular power, who received him into their Juriſdiction, without any Writ, but only by virtue of the Biſh. Letters, according to a Stature made, <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. when they had degraded Mr. <hi>Bayfeild,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62591:30"/>the Biſhop being preſent, ſtruck him with his Croſier Staff that he had in his hand, on the breſt, with ſuch violence, that he overturned Mr. <hi>Bayfeild,</hi> who was on his knees before him, and falling back on the pavement broke his head, ſo that he lay a while ſtun'd and in a ſwone, ere they could bring him to himſelf. When he ſaid I rejoyce that I am deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Church of Antichriſt, and that I now am of the true Church of Chriſt militant on Earth, and truſt that ere long I ſhall be in Heaven with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Church triumphant for ever. From the Quire they had him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and thence after an hours time which he ſpent in prayer, they led him to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> who went very chearfully, and there for want of a ſpeedy fire, he was half an hour alive after they had enkindled the fewel, and when that his left arm was burning and on a flame, he rub'd it with his right, till it fell off into the fire from his body, and then he continued in prayer, to the end without moving. This was the end of this godly ſtout Martyr on the 20 of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1532.</p>

The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop often urged him to recant his hereſies which he ſo well defended, but he anſwered them that he no way erred from the true doctrine of the ancient mother Church.

At length, one beating off the Iron ring that faſtened his neck to the Stake, let him fill down into the fire, and ſo he was at laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to Aſhes. About the ſame time one <hi>Rogers</hi> was burnt in <hi>Northfolk,</hi> by means of that Biſhop, and the Duke, upon the 6 Articles.</p>

After which an order was granted for the writ <hi>de Comburendo,</hi> &amp;c. and that he ſhould be burnt at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> which did not a little rejoyce this good man, that he ſhould die in his own Dioceſs, and there confirm the Doctrine he had taught, with his blood. On the 5th of <hi>Febuary</hi> early in the morning, he was delivered to ſome of the Queens Guards, who conducted him on horſeback to <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and delivered him to the Sheriffs there, in order to his Execution the next Day; the Lord <hi>Chandois</hi> and ſeveral others, being made Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for that purpoſe. That night before his death, he went to bed early, and having had his firſt ſleep, which was ſound, he ſpent the reſt in prayer, having deſired of the Sheriffs that he might not be diſturbed by any, till they came to have him away, which was granted, and about 8 of the Clock the next morning, with a great Guard they fetched this good man to carry him to his burning, to which he walked on foot, in a borrowed Gown, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people bewailing him, crying, and wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hands. But he exhorted them to patience, and told them he came not to dye as a Traytor, but becauſe he would not account that Hereſie and falſe Doctrine, which he preached to them when
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62591:51"/>he was their Paſtor. He look'd very chearfully, as he went, and more ruddy than uſually, but he was Commanded not to ſpeak to the people; ſo they ſtop'd his mouth, which he was fain to ſubmit to, tho it grieved him to ſee the people weep ſo bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but lifting his eyes to heaven, he prayed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he came to the Stake, and the preparation was made for him, near unto the great Elme, near the Colledg of Prieſts, where he uſed to preach to the people, he kneeled down, beckning to ſeveral that he knew, to hearken to his prayers, but the Officers did all they could to keep the people at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that they might not hear him. In the midſt of his prayer, a Box was brought and lay'd before him, in which they ſaid was his pardon, if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, at which he cryed out, if you Love my ſoul away with it, if you love my ſoul away with it: defiring them not to interrupt his prayers. Then ſaid the L. <hi>Chandois</hi> ſeeing there is no remedy, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him quickly. At which the good man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sheriffs, told them, all the favour he deſired of them was, that he might make an end of his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and that he might have a quick fire. His pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers being finiſhed he pulled off his Gown, and gave it to the Sheriffs to be delivered to him that lent it, and ſtripping himſelf to his doublet &amp; breeches, he thought to be burned in them, but the Sheriffs made him ſtrip all off to his ſhirt, which he ſubmitted to, and taking a poynt from his Hoſe he truſſed up his Shirt between his leggs where they cauſed about a pound of Gunpowder in a bagg to be placed, and as much under either Arm: then they brought Iron hoops to put about his leggs, neck, and middle, but he refuſed them, ſaying that he knew God would give him ſtrength to indure the torment of the fire without them; yet at laſt he was perſwaded to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one about his middle, &amp; his belly being ſwell'd and big by lying in priſon, it pinch'd him much. After he was placed, he look'd about and ſaw the people round him bitterly weeping, but not being ſuffered to ſpeak to them, he lifted up his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62591:52"/>Heaven and prayed to himſelf. After he had done, the executioner came to ask him forgiveneſs, to whom he ſaid he knew not that he had ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him; to whom he replyed: I am appoynted to ſet fire to you to burn you; In that ſaid Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> thou doſt nothing offend me, God forgive thee thy ſins and do thy office. Then the reeds being put about him, he took them in his Arms and Kiſſed them, giving order how they ſhould be placed: preſently fire was ordered to be put to him, but by reaſon the faggots were green and alſo very few, they put this holy man to intollerable torments, and the wind being alſo ſtrong, blew the flame from him ſo that he was only ſcorched by the fire. Then they fetch'd ſome dry faggots and made a new fire, but all the reeds being gone, they burnt his neither parts, and never reach'd his upper parts, only ſcorch'd and Shriffled his Skin, and burnt his hair. All which time this holy Martyr was heard to pray as one without pain, O <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>David</hi> have mercy upon me, and receive my ſoul: After this ſecond fire was ſpent, he wiped his eyes with his hands, and beholding the People he ſaid with an indifferent loud voyce. For <hi>God's Love good People let me have more fire,</hi> and all the while his neither paris were burning. Then they made a 3d fire more extream than the other, &amp; then the bladders of Gunpowder broke, which did not much good, by reaſon the wind was ſo Violent; then he prayed with a loud voyce, <hi>Lord Jeſus have mercy upon me, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit:</hi> theſe were the laſt words he was heard to ſpeak; but when his lipps and mouth were black as a Coal, and his tongue ſwelled, they were perceived to move till his lips were quire burnt away. Then he knocked his breaſt with his hands till one of his Arms fell off, and then he knocked it ſtill with the other whilſt water, fat and blood fryed out at his fingers ends: at laſt they renewed the fire when bending his body over the hoop of Iron he yeilded up his Spirit.</p>
                  <p>On the ſame day that this laſt mentioned holy

At his going away from the Biſhop, he kneeled down on the floor, and lifting up both his hands with a loud voyce he ſay'd: <q rend="margQuotes">From the Tyranny of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all his deteſtable errors, Idolatries, and abominations, Good Lord deliver us.</q> When in priſon, he ſo preached to the reſt of the priſoners there, and uſed ſuch godly exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diſcourſes, leading alſo ſo ſtrict and holy a life, that he wrought upon many and converted them from their Superſtitious errors. He was alſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62591:53"/>very Charitable while he had it, relieving others, tho he had a Wife and 9 Children: but they ſoon deprived him of his benefice, ſo that he had nothing to ſupport him, but the charity of good people, which with Gods providence he found ſufficient. Several examinations he had before the Biſhops, where he ſtrenuouſly maintained his poſitions, for the Clergies Marriage, and againſt the Corporeal preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, but at laſt, they overcame him, with their Temporal Weapon, perſecuting power, backt by Statute Law, and by it they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, with Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> and others to death, as Hereticks to be burnt alive. After this ſentence he was degraded, by Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> in priſon, and they were compelled by main force to put on their Popiſh Trinkets upon his back, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeing to do it himſelf, and after they had notch'd his Hair and pair'd orſcrap'd his fingers ends, and with all their foppiſh Ceremonies ſtript him of his Popiſh habiliments, when the Biſhop ſhould have ſtruck him on the Breaſt with his ſtaff, ſeeing the ſturdineſs of the Doctor, who was a portly bigg man, <hi>Bonner</hi> was afraid, and omitted that laſt Ceremony, leſt the Dr. ſhould have ſtruck him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The next day after this his degradation, which is like the laſt unction for the burial, at two of the Clock in the morning the Sheriffs took him and delivered him to his Guards, who were to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to <hi>Hadley</hi> to be burnt there, at which he rejoyced being willing to ſeal the Doctrine he had there preached with his blood. His Wife fearing they would have him away by night (for they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed daylight and the people) ſhe watched all night with two Children in the Porch of St. <hi>Buttolphs</hi> Church near <hi>Algate,</hi> which way ſhe knew he muſt paſs, and about 3 of the Clock it being very dark ſhe heard the noiſe of the guard, at which ſhe ran out to her husband, where was ſuch a moaning and pathetick greeting, or rather ſeparation, that the Sheriffs wept, but forced her to depart and led him
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62591:53"/>to the ſign of the Woolſack, where he was put on horſeback with a hood over his face, a place made for his Eyes to look out at, and a ſlit for his Mouth that he might breath; After this manner they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him along that he might not be known; all which he patiently ſuffered. When he was come to <hi>Suffolk</hi> many of the Gentry and Juſtices of the peace met him, of his friends and acquaintance, all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to perſwade him to ſave his Life, by Recantation, offering him not only pardon for his Life, but great promotions, even a Biſhoprick. But this good and conſtant profeſſor of the Goſpel, ſtrengthned by Gods holy Spirit, refuſed all thoſe Temptations; coming to <hi>Hadley</hi> he rode thorow the Town, where the poor people were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with grievous Moans and Tears, Kneeling down and with lifted up hands, prayed to God to ſtrengthen him, to whom he ſayd (That he had preached to them Gods Word &amp; the Truth, and that he was now come to ſeal it with his blood. But the Officers reproved the people and kept them off; when that they came againſt the Alms houſes, what mony he had left, he put it into a glove and flung it to them, having no more need of money now, for they led him ſtraight to the place of his execution without the Town on a Common. The Council and Biſhops had threatned to cut off his Tongue unleſs he would promiſe not to ſay any thing to the people, of which promiſe the Sheriffs now put him in mind, telling him, it was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to talk, ſo afraid were they to hear the Truth.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62591:55"/>Conſcience not permitting him, he refuſed, for which he was threatned to be lay'd hold on, and his Mr. fearing he ſhould bring him into trouble, ſent him away to his Father, who dwelt, at <hi>Burntwood</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> where he continued about ſix weeks, when one day reading in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible, which he found in the Church, the Vicar and one more, called him heretick but he diſputed with them after ſuch a manner, that they could ſay nothing againſt him but they went and complained to the Juſtice of Peace, who ſent for <hi>Will.</hi> but he having ſome notice of it fled, and hid himſelf, upon which the Juſtice ſent for his Father, and threatned to ſend him to priſon, unleſs he would find out his ſon; at which the old man was much troubled, yet promiſed to look about as he did, tho not with any intent to diſcover him if he had known where he had been: but the good ſon hearing that his Father was like to be brought into trouble for him, came from the place where he was hid to his Father; and tho he would have perſwaded him to the Contrary, he would not leave him but went home with him; where he was no ſooner come, but he was taken by the Conſtable and carried before one Juſtice <hi>Brown,</hi> who would needs diſpute with this youth concerning the real preſence in the Sacrament; but <hi>Will. Hunter</hi> being too hard for him, he flung away the Bible in a Rage, and ſent him up to Biſhop <hi>Bonner,</hi> who alſo argued the caſe with him but finding that he could not prevail upon him, he put him into the Stocks in his Gate-houſe, where he continued 2 days and 2 nights without any thing but a Cruſt of Bread and a Cup of water, which he would not touch. After this the Biſhop ſent for him again, and finding him ſtill in the ſame mind, refuſeing to deny his Faith, he ſent him to the priſon where the Convict were kept, and cauſed him to be loaden with as many irons as he could bear. There he lay near three quarters of a year, having only a halfpeny a day, of the Biſhop, for bread and drink. In which time he had been 4 or 5 times before the Biſhop, ſometimes threatning him
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62591:55"/>with burning, at other times flattering him and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him perferment, as to make him a Freeman, and to give him 40 <hi>l.</hi> to ſet up his trade, or elſe he would make him his Steward, finding him a witty young man; But he anſwered that unleſs he could convince his Conſcience by the Scriptures, he could not turn from his Faith and from God, for the Love of the World, for that be accounted all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things but loſs and dung in reſpect of the Love of Chriſt. After this he was Condemned and ſent to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and thence to <hi>Burntwood</hi> to be Martyred. Thither he was carried, and received by the Sheriffs, he ſhewing an Admirable Conſtancy. His father and mother being of the ſame faith, tho tender of him, rejoyced to ſee his undaunted Conſtancy, he being ſo young a man his mother ſaying, ſhe was heattily glad that ſhe was ſo happy, as to bear ſuch a child who could find in his heart to loſe his life ſo willingly for Chriſts name ſake. Ah mother (ſaid <hi>William</hi>) for the little pain I am like to ſuffer, <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath promiſed me a Crown of Joy. You may be glad of that; then his mother kneeling on her knees ſaid, I pray God to ſtrengthen thee to the End, for I think thee as well beſtow'd as any child that I ever bare. The night before he was burnt, he ſaw every thing in his dream that hapned the next day and related it when he awaked, to his fellow priſoner, who was alſo burnt not long after in another place, which we ſhall mention, and every Circumſtance of it was fulfilled: when he came to the place of execution according to his dream, the Queens pardon was offer'd if he would recant, but he refuſed it, but goeing to the Stake ſtood upright againſt it, to which they bound him; and whilſt they were placing the faggots about him, he deſired the People to pray from him ſo long as they ſaw he was alive, and deſired they would quickly diſpatch him. Then the Juſtice ſaid that he would pray no more for him than for a Dog. Then ſaid <hi>William</hi> I pray God, Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> this my death be not laid to your charge, in the laſt day: however I forgive you.

At laſt the Biſhop read the ſentence of Condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and after he had done, now ſaid he I will pray for thee no more than for a dog. But I will pray for you ſaid the holy Martyr. He was then delivered to the Sheriffs, who put him into an hole or dark dungeon, where none were ſuffered to come at him or ſpeak to him. When the time came of his execution, he was led forth to the place, being without the City of <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> and being come to the Stake a black Box was ſhewed him, in which they ſaid there was the Queens pardon, if he would recant: He told them that he had no deſire to dye, and would accept of her Graces mercy, being her true Leige man, but if he could not have it without ſuch Conditions, which tended to pluck him from God, he would not receive it. After that he began to ſpeak to the people, but the Sheriffs told him, there muſt be no Sermoning there, ſo afraid were

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:62591:60"/>whom we have formerly mentioned to have been Condemned with 5 other Martyrs, whoſe ſtorys we have given you; but this Gentleman, for he was one and bred a Courtier, haveing ſerved the Earl of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> all the time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> was reſpited till this time, in hopes to prevail with him to recant, tho in vain, for he was moſt conſtant and reſolute not to deny his Faith, for he boldly told the Biſhop, that if he had an hundred lives and an hundred bodys, he would give them all to be torn to pieces reather than abjure and recant. He was firſt taken, becauſe he had kept his child 3 weeks without Chriſtning it, becauſe it was againſt his Conſcience to yeild to their Popiſh Ceremonies, as their Oyl, Salt, Cream, Spittle, Candle, and conjuring Water, which he decalred, was not of divine Inſtitution, but mens fooliſh Inventions. For this he was had before the Biſhop, and he being a man of parts, and a gentleman, much pains was taken with him, and he was much pittied, for that he was a very handſom man, of a fine make, and ſweet Countenance, and of an excellent ſweet nature. But all this was nothing to the Love he bore to God, for whoſe ſake he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook all the offers and pleaſures of the world, to undergo a rigorous Death. After his Condemnation aforeſaid, he was ſent into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and delivered over to the Lord <hi>Rich</hi> to ſee him burnt, who brought him guarded to the place of execution, which was at <hi>Coxhall</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> A little before the time, he uſed much exhortation to his Friends, to be ſtedfaſt in the Faith, ſome of which were greatly confirmed by him, both by his talk and example, but much more by his death, for ſome of them, who feared the ſharpneſs of the puniſhment, and thought it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable to the fleſh, deſired of him, if he were able, to give them a privat ſign when he was burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if it were to be born, which he promiſed to do, and if that the pain were tollerable and might be quietly born, he would lift up his hands over his head before he gave up the Ghoſt. After he came to the place, with fervent prayers made to God
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62591:61"/>he with great patience and meekneſs addreſſed himſelf for the Fire, being bound to the Stake with a chain, an innumerable company of people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing him and lamenting him. After he had ſpoken many things to the Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> concerning their ſhedding thus the innocent blood of Gods Saints, and that his prayers were ended, they ſet fire to him, in which he continued long and when that his ſpeech was taken away, with the violence of the fire, and his skin ſhrivled and drawn together, and his fingers ends conſumed in the flame, and the reſt of his Arms and body burning, ſo that all men thought he had been certainly dead, ſuddenly and contrary to all expectation, being mindful of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to his friends he reached up his hands over his head, burning of a light fire, and, as it were rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, clapt them together 3 times, to the amazement of all the people; upon which aroſe ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry or ſhout, eſpecially by thoſe who underſtood the ſign, that the like had not been heard. After which this bleſſed Martyr ſinking down into the fire gave up the Ghoſt, being a moſt Conſtant and faithful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to give you briefly, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the noted Mr. <hi>Bradfood,</hi> a godly Preacher and holy Martyr for the Goſpel of Chriſt. Mr. <hi>John Bradford</hi> was born at <hi>Mancheſter</hi> in <hi>Lancaſterſhire,</hi> being brought up in Learning by his parents, attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to great perfection in the Latin tongue, in ready writing, and in Accounts, which preferred him to the ſervice of Sr. <hi>John Harrington</hi> Knight, who was Treaſurer of the Kings Camp and buildings, by him Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> was imployed, both at home and abroad beyond ſeas, and he was in a thriving way, and ready for great preferment; But God having otherwaies deſigned this then young Man, called him, to the Goſpel, and to the ſtudy of the H. Scriptures. Finding a call in himſelf, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly embraced it, looking upon it as the Spirit of God, that prompted him to forſake worldly Riches, preferment, and Honour, in the way he was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to retire to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for the benefit of his ſtudies, and to ſit him for the Miniſtry. He had not been in the Univerſity above a year, but he obtained the Degree of Mr. of Arts, and not long after he had a fellowſhip given him in <hi>Pembroke</hi> Hall; Where the learned <hi>Bucer</hi> being acquainted with him, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him up to the Miniſtry And Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> Biſhop of

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62591:62"/>ſeem'd to be his whole Life. He eat but one meal a day, and that but little. He was almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually on his Knees: Often muſeing and bitterly weeping to himſelf. He was ſomewhat tall of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of a ſanguine complexion, with an awbourn hair and beard. He ſeldom ſlept above 4 hours in a night, and alwaies read in his bed till ſleep came. He counted that hour ill ſpent in which he did not ſome good. He was very Charitable and Liberal to his fellow priſoners. He was much beloved through his winning carriage, even of his Keepers, who gave him ſuch liberty, that he might have got away if he would; nay, they often let him go forth on his word, which they were ſure of, he being alwaies moſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. He was ſeveral times brought before the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and before <hi>Bonner,</hi> and other Biſhops, and much pains was taken by ſeveral of the moſt learned among them, to bring him over to them, but in vain; for he ſo confounded them with the Scriptures, and manifeſted the Truth to them concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in his Sacrament, that they knew not what to ſay to him, but having the power in their hands, they condemned him as an Heretick, to be burnt, and reading the ſentence to him, when the Chancellor came to the word <hi>Johannes Bradford Laicus,</hi> ha! (Said he) is he no Prieſt? to which Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> replyed, no, he never was Prieſt, nor beneficed, nor Married, nor a Preacher, till publick Authority had Eſtabliſhed Religion. After which he fell down on his Knees, and heartily thanked God, that he counted him worthy to ſuffer for his name ſake. They had kept him near 2 years in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and he was now condemned on the laſt of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> from which time, to the 1ſt of <hi>July,</hi> they kept him in priſon, where they had ſeveral conferences with him, but he ſtill kept conſtant and unſhaken in his faith. Not long before his burning he dreamed all the order of it as it afterward happened. They had an intent to have ſent him to <hi>Mancheſter</hi> to have been burnt there, but their minds altering they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it to be done in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> One afternoon as he was walking in his Chamber, the Keepers wife
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62591:63"/>came runing to him almoſt out of Breath, &amp; amazed and crying, O Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> I come to bring you hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy news. What is that ſaid he? That you muſt be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp; your chain is now buying. Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> pulling off his Gap, and lifting up his eyes towards heaven, ſaid I thank God for it: I have looked for it a long time, it is no unexpected thing, the Lord make me worthy of it. The rumor of Mr. <hi>Bradfords</hi> burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon ſpread thorow the City, and by 4 a clock in the morning people began to gather together in the ſtreets: As he was paſſing between <hi>Nowgate</hi> and <hi>Smithfield,</hi> his Brother in Law came and took him by the hand, to take his laſt leave of him, for which <hi>Woodriff</hi> the dogged Sheriff ſtruck him over the head till the blood ran down his face, which grieving Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> he deſired him to remember him to his Mother, and others of his friends, and ſo diſmiſt him. This ſheriff was a great perſecutor of Gods Saints, rejoycing much at their ſufferings, whereas his brother never ſaw their Martyrdoms with dry eyes, much pitty and Commiſeration. But God met with him, for not long after Mr. <hi>Bradfords</hi> burning he was ſuddenly ſtruck with a dead palſie, ſo that for 8 years till he dyed, he could not turn in his Bed, but as he was helped. When Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> came to the place, he fell flat on his face and prayed to himſelf a good ſpace. At the ſame time, there was to ſuffer with him, for the ſame cauſe one <hi>John Leaf</hi> a <hi>London</hi> Apprentice to a Tallow-Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, a mere ſtripling of 18 or nineteen years of Age, at the moſt, who had moſt ſtoutly and reſolutely confeſſed his Faith touching the Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Biſhop <hi>Bonner,</hi> touching auricular confeſſion, &amp; other points to which he argued very orthodoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, having been well grounded therein, by the Holy Martyr Mr, <hi>Rogers</hi> whoſe Schollar he was. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been condemned, whilſt in priſon, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſent to him a Recantation in writing, and alſo his confeſſion, bidding him to chooſe, which he would ſign, the one was for his Life, the other his Death. The young man could not write nor read, therefore cauſed the writings to be read to him,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62591:63"/>and when he had heard the recantation, he diſliked it, and ſaid he would not ſign it, but hearing his own confeſſion read he ſaid, he approved that, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon pricked his finger with a needle, he took of his blood, and made a mark on the paper, and bid them tell the Biſhop, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſigned that with his Blood. This young Man having undauntedly ſigned this Bill, was the ſame day brought with Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> to the ſtake, where he alſo lay flat on his face on the ground praying, on the other ſide of the ſtake, till the Sheriff bid them diſpatch, for that the preſs of the people was great. At which words they both ſtood up, when Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> taking a faggot in his hands, he Kiſſed it, as likewiſe the ſtake, then ſtripping himſelf, he went &amp; ſtood by the ſtake and ſaid, <hi>O England, England,</hi> repent thee of thy ſins, repent <hi>thee of</hi> thy Sins. Beware of Idolatry, beware of <hi>falſe</hi> Antichriſts, take beed they do not deceive <hi>you.</hi> Upon this the Sheriff bid them bind him and tye his hands if he would not be quiet. <hi>O</hi> Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> I am quiet ſaid Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> God <hi>forgive</hi> you. To which one of his Officers reply'd, you had beſt hold your peace, if this be your learning, you are a Fool. Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> ſaw how it was; that he might not be permitted to ſpeak, he anſwered not, but ſaying as he forgave all the world, ſo he asked forgiveneſs of all men, and deſired the people to pray for him. Then turning his head to the young man who ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him he ſaid be of good comfort Brother: for we ſhall have a merry ſupper with the Lord this night, then embracing the Reeds, he ſaid, Strait is the way, and narrow is the Gate that leadeth to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation and few there be that find it. Then fire being put to them they both with great patience and conſtancy ended their lives in the Fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration in their countinances, being voyd of all fear hoping to obtain (as no doubt they did) the heavenly reward for all their ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>The next day after Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> ſuffered in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> one <hi>William Minge</hi> a Prieſt, ſhould have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> but that he dyed in priſon. On the

                  </p>
                  <p>On the 12th day of <hi>July</hi> 4 men, viz. <hi>John Bland</hi> Miniſter of the pariſh of <hi>Adiſham</hi> in <hi>Kent, John Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Vicar of <hi>Rolvindon, Nicholas Shetterden</hi> and <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry Middleton,</hi> all of the ſame County, were long impriſoned at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and after ſeveral exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Articles exhibited againſt them, they all ſtanding firm to the Truth, for the Goſpels ſake ſuffered all in one fire, at two ſeveral Stakes, in the City of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

                     <hi>Chriſtopher Waid</hi> was of <hi>Dartford</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent</hi> a Linnen weaver, Condemned alſo upon the like Articles, by the aforeſaid Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and burnt at <hi>Dartford,</hi> in the ſame month of <hi>July,</hi> at a place called the <hi>Brimth</hi> without the town, the Common place of Execution of Felons. As he was goeing to his Martyrdom one <hi>Margery Pooly</hi> of the Town of <hi>Tunbridg</hi> a widdow, who was afterwards Martyr'd, ſaid to him, you may rejoyce <hi>Waid</hi> to ſee ſuch a company gathered to celebrate your Marriage this day. Being come to the place, he ſtript himſelf &amp; put on a fair white ſhirt delivered to him by his wife, when coming to the Stake, he took it in his arms and embraced it, and Kiſſing it, he ſet his back to it and was faſtned to it with an Iron hoop, ſtanding in a Pitch'd Barrel: being thus ſetled he ſpake with a clear and chearful voyce the laſt verſe

The Sheriff bid him to be quiet and dye patiently, then puting the reeds before his mouth, he made a hole with his hands, that his voyce might be heard, but ſome flung faggots at the hole and hurt his face: when at laſt fire being put to him he cryed out often, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Soul,</hi> without any ſign of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience; at laſt holding up his hands above his head, he continued in that poſture without moving them, even after he was dead, as if they had been propped up with Stakes; being a token to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, according to his prayer, of his Conſtancy, to their ſhame and Confuſion.</p>

And, ſaid He, I doubt not but God will ſhew you ſome ſign thereof. And it hapned to the great Confirmation of the people, that after he was almoſt half burnt, and that his Body was as black as a Coal, and drawn together in a lump, all men thinking that, he had been dead, ſuddenly he roſe upright before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and lifting up the burning Stumps of his Arms, and Clapping them together, did as it were declare to them the rejoycing of his Heart, then bending down again, and hanging over the flames, he ſlept in the Lord, and ſo ended his Mortal Life.</p>

He was not long there, but he had notice to prepare himſelf the next day to dye, which he Chearfully received, ſpending his time in prayers. In the Morning about 8 of the Clock, the Sheriffs came for him, who came to them with a Joyful counteuance, and was led to the place of execution in <hi>Smithfield;</hi> when he came to the ſtake he kneeled down ſaying theſe words, I <hi>will pay my vows in thee, O</hi> Smithfield; After he had kiſſed the ſtake, <hi>ſhall I disdain</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to ſuffer at this Stake, ſeeing my Redemer did not refuſe to ſuffer a moſt vile Death</hi> upon the Croſs for me? Then he ſaid the 106, 107 and 108 Pſalms, and when he had done praying, he gave mony to the Officers, and ſo was bound to the ſtake, and fire was ſoon ſet to him, and in the midſt of thoſe fiery flames he yielded his ſoul into the hands of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, like a Lamb without ſtrugling.

But he had no ſooner freed himſelf of the ſnare, but he found peace and Joy within, and being condemned, went chearfully with the reſt to the fire, and ſealed his Religion with his blood.</p>

                  <p>O Father of Heaven, O Son of God Redeemer of the World, O holy Ghoſt, three Perſons and one God, have mercy upon me, moſt wretched Catif and miſerable ſinner.

To thee therefore O Lord do I run, to thee do I humble my ſelf, ſaying, O Lord my God, my ſins are great, yet have mercy upon me for thy great mercy. The great myſtery that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Man was not wrought for little or few offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thou didſt not give thy Son (O Heavenly Father) unto death for ſmall ſins only, but for all the greateſt ſins in the world, ſo that the ſinner return to thee with his whole heart, as I do here at this preſent. Wherefore have mercy on me O God, whoſe property is always to have Mercy. Have mercy upon me O Lord for thy great mercy.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62591:82"/>heal us both, thee of thy blindneſs, and me of my lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</hi> And ſo patiently, fire being put to them; theſe two poor men but holy Martyrs, ſuffered in the fire and praiſing God, yeilded up their Souls into his hands, whoſe name to the end they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly confeſſed.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>July</hi> following, the 16th day, ſuffered that memorable Martyr, Mr. <hi>Julius Palmer,</hi> with two others in one fire at <hi>Newberry,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory I ſhall briefly relace. This <hi>Julius</hi> was born in <hi>Coventry</hi> of good parentage, his father being an Upholſter, and a Merchant, and had been Mayor of that City, he was bred at School, and ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he profited much in the tongues, and Philoſophy, and many times ſupplyed the place of the Gr. Reader in <hi>Magdalin</hi> Colledg, where he became Batchellor of Art, and became at laſt Fellow of the ſaid Colledg, when he began to ſtudy divinity: He was of a very civil behaviour, courteous, pleaſant, and chearful, without affectation, and of great ſimplicity, not knowing how to diſſemble, an indefatigable Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, riſeing at 4 of the clock every morning to his Studies, and ſitting up till 11 at night, ſo that in a little time he profited much. He was admitted to the office of a Reader in Logick, and thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a ſtiff and zealous Papiſt, till the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then owned the cauſe of the <hi>Pope</hi> ſo far, that he was expelled the Colledg, and was fain to go and teach School privatly, Continuing thus all the Time of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and when Papiſtry was reſtored by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> he was alſo reſtored to his fellowſhip in the Colledg, having for his Religion undergone much hardſhip: yet ſee the providence of God, to bring this man home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for it was the blood of the Martyrs, which is the ſeed of the Church, and their Conſtant ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which made him firſt to begin to look into the Doctrine they profeſſed, and it ſo pleaſed God to open his eyes, that in a ſhort time he began to ſee clearly the Superſtition and Idolatry of the Popiſh Church, and being one who knew not how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble againſt his Conſcience, he was ſoon taken

Let God do as he pleaſe I will commit my ſelf to him and to the wide World.</hi> And being adviſed by another to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the fire, for it was no eaſy matter to burn he reply'd, I <hi>have yet eſcaped it, but I verily believe it will be my end, at laſt, welcome be it by the grace of God, it will be eaſie to be ſuffered, by the grace of God.</hi> He for ſome time kept School at <hi>Reading</hi> in <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> but after a time being found to be a Goſpeller he was forced to fly thence, and repairing to his own Mother, who was a Papiſt, and had heard of his turning from their Religion, hoping to obtain ſome monys due to him by his fathers will, and asking her bleſſing as he uſed to do, the unnatural Mother Cry'd out, <hi>thou ſhalt have Chriſts Curſe and mine, where ever thou goeſt;</hi> being troubled at this heavy greeting, &amp; amazed for a time, he at laſt ſaid, <hi>ah! Mother you may give me your curſe,</hi> which <hi>God Knows I never</hi> deſerv'd, but <hi>God's Curſe you Cannot give me for, he hath already bleſſed me.</hi> With that ſhe reviled him, giving him moſt bitter taunts, calling him Renegade, and one who had embraced a new upſtart Doctrine. It is not new (ſaid he) but as old as Chriſt and his Apoſtles; with that ſhe charged him to go out of her ſight and never ſee her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, flinging to him a piece of Gold, and ſo leaving him to his ſorrows. But being ſought after,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62591:84"/>it was not long e're he was taken, and caſt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in a Dungeon prepared for thieves and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and there left for a time hanging by the hands and feet in a pair of Stocks ſo high, that no part of his Body could touch the Ground: in this Cave or Dungeon he remained 10 days, under the Tyranny of an unmerciful Keeper. After this he was ſeveral times examined before the Mayor of <hi>Reading,</hi> and before the Biſhop of <hi>Sarums</hi> Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; from <hi>Reading</hi> he was had to <hi>Newberry,</hi> and clapt in the Jail there, where he found two others, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>John Guin</hi> and <hi>Thomas Askin,</hi> poor ſimple men, who were Martyred with him. Here he had his laſt examination, and was condemned with the two aforeſaid Perſons by Dr. <hi>Jeffrey.</hi> Many endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were try'd to make him recant, and great proffers of preferments to tempt him, but nothing would move him, and he alſo confirmed his fellow ſufferers in their Faith: <q rend="margQuotes">
                        <hi>Happy are you when men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile you; and perſecute you for Righteouſneſs ſake. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be glad for great is your</hi> reward in Heaven. Fear not them that can kill the Body, but are not able to touch the ſoul. God is faithful, &amp; will not let us be tempted further than we can bear. We ſhall not end our lives but make a change only for a better life.</q> With the like comfortable ſpeeches he cheared his fellow Martyrs, and cauſed tears to fall from others who heard him. When they came to the place of execution, they fell all 3 on their faces, and prayed, and <hi>Mr. Paimer</hi> recited aloud the 31 Pſalm: After that two Popiſh Prieſts urged him to recant, but he cry'd to them <hi>away, away,</hi> tempt <hi>me no longer: Away I ſay from me all yee that work In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, for the Lord hath heard the voyce of my Tears.</hi> Forthwith they ſtripped themſelves, went to the ſtake, Kiſſed it, and were bound to it, then Mr. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> ſaid: <hi>Good people pray for us that we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere to the end. And for Chriſt's ſake beware of Popiſh teachers for they deceive you,</hi> with that one of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers threw a faggot at him, and hit him on the face that all the blood ran down. When the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62591:85"/>fire was kindled, and begun to take hold of their Bodys, they lifted up their hands towards Heaven, and quietly and chearfully as if they felt no pain, cry'd, <hi>Lord Jeſus Strengthen us: Lord Jeſus aſſiſt us. Lord Jeſus receive our Souls.</hi> And thus they all end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Lives without any ſtrugling, only <hi>Julius</hi> when that all people thought him dead, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt burnt to pieces, he was on a ſudden ſeen, as if awaked out of a ſleep, to move his tongue and Jaws, and heard to pronounce ſoftly the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſo being burnt to Aſhes yeilded to God his ſoul.</p>
